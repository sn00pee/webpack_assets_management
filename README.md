# Goal

We want a build that generates a perfect structure of something that can be uploaded directly to teamsite

So for this workshop, our final structure should look something like this:

```ascii
.
├── com
│   ├── css
│   │   └── index.css
│   ├── img
│   │   └── test.jpg
│   └── js
│       └── index.js
├── example
│   └── html
│       └── index.html
└── inc
    ├── footer.html
    └── header.html
```

Simple, yet different from the original source structure
